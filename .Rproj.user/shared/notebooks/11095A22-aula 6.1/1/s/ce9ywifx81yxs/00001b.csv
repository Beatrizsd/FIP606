"1","Effect sizes were labelled following Cohen's (1988) recommendations.

The Two Sample t-test testing the difference between Mg2 and control (mean of x = 10.52, mean of y = 15.68) suggests that the
effect is negative, statistically significant, and large (difference = -5.16, 95% CI [-6.49, -3.83], t(18) = -8.15, p < .001;
Cohen's d = -3.65, 95% CI [-5.10, -2.16])
